	<img src="b1.jpg" height="150px" width="150px">
	<p>I started to learn cooking from when i was 8 years old. Now, I try to create new recipes using only the available items. Thereby not buying extra ingredients to make new food items. Watching a lot of youtue videos helps to create recipes because we'll know about the cominations that can be used.</p>

	<p>I always loved to dance, it's a kind of stress buster for me. Then I started to choreograph songs for annual day dances and a few for my dance institution classes. It's an amazing way to workout as well.</p></div><br>
